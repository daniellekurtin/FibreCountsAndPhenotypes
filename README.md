# FibreCountsAndPhenotypes
Code that assesses the relationship between phenotype and fibre counts for Shivani Patel's thesis

# Decription 
This MATLAB live script reads in a file of fibre counts in different brain regions and runs linear mixed effects models to assess whether different neurodegenerate phenotypes (Parkinson's Disease, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and more) explain the variance in protein fibre counts across the brain. Email Shivani Patel for requests about the data.

# Dependencies
This script calles the following packages:
1. gramm
2. fdr
3. violinplot
